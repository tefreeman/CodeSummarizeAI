Here is a concise summary of the code content in `request-file-cache.service.ts`:

This file contains a service for caching files using the Ionic Native File plugin. The service has three methods:

1. `cache(fileName: string, obj: any)`: Creates a new file with the given name and stores the provided object in it.
2. `clearCachedFile(fileName: string)`: Removes the file with the given name from the cache.
3. `checkIfFileCached(fileName: string)`: Checks if a file with the given name exists in the cache.

The service uses the `File` plugin to interact with the file system and provides methods for caching, clearing, and checking the existence of files.
