Here is a concise summary of the code content in the file `request-json-cache.service.ts`:

The `RequestJsonCacheService` class provides methods for caching JSON data using NativeStorage. The service has three main methods:

1. `cache(key: string, obj: any, expireDate: number)`: Stores an object with a specified expiration date in NativeStorage.
2. `clearAllItems()`: Clears all items from NativeStorage.
3. `getCachedIfExists(key: string)`: Retrieves an object from NativeStorage if it exists and has not expired. If the object is expired or does not exist, returns false.

The service also has a private method `isExpired(expireDate: number): boolean` to check if a date has expired.
