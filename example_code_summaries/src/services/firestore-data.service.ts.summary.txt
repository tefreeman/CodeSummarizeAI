Here is a summary of the code content in `firestore-data.service.ts`:

* The service is injected with `AngularFireAuth`, `AngularFirestore`, and `Router`.
* It defines an interface `User` with properties `uid`, `email`, `photoURL`, `displayName`, and `favoriteColor`.
* It defines an observable `user` that retrieves the current user's data from Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
* The service has three methods:
	+ `updateUserData(user)`: updates the user's data in Firestore on login.
	+ `getPlacesDB(id)`: retrieves a collection of places from Firestore based on an ID.
	+ `getUser()`: returns the current user's data.
* The service uses `switchMap` and `first` operators to handle authentication state changes and retrieve the user's data.
