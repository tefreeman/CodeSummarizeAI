Here is a summary of the code content in auth.service.ts:

The AuthService is an Angular service responsible for handling authentication and authorization. It provides methods for creating a new user, signing in with email and password, signing in with Google, Facebook, or Twitter, resetting a password, and signing out.

The service uses Firebase Authentication to interact with the Firebase backend. It also uses the Firestore database to store and retrieve user data.

The methods in this service are:

* `emailSignUp`: Creates a new user with an email and password.
* `emailLogin`: Signs in a user with an email and password.
* `googleLogin`, `FacebookLogin`, `TwitterLogin`: Signs in a user with their Google, Facebook, or Twitter account.
* `oAuthLogin`: A helper method that signs in a user with an OAuth provider.
* `resetPassword`: Resets a user's password.
* `signOut`: Signs out the current user.
* `isLoggedIn`: Returns a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating whether the user is logged in.

The service also has a constructor that takes four dependencies: `FireStoreDataService`, `AngularFireAuth`, `AngularFirestore`, and `Router`.
